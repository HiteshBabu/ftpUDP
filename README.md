The link speed between the sender and receiver is 100Mbps and the test file size must be at least 1GBytes. 
You should emulate the delay and the loss rate of the link using the delay node. 
You should test your system under various different conditions. 
However two settings that you must expose your system for the assignment are:  


1.The Delay (RTT) of 10ms with the Loss rate of 1% 

2.The Delay (RTT) of 200ms with the Loss rate of 20%


The developed code achieves 45 Mbps under 1st condition and 30 Mbps under 2nd condition
